This page provides supplemental information about organization policy constraints that apply to Cloud Load Balancing. You use organization policy constraints to enforce settings across an entire project, folder, or organization.

Organization policies only apply to new resources. Constraints are not enforced retroactively. If you have pre-existing load-balancing resources that are in violation of a new organization policy, you will need to address such violations manually.

For a complete list of available constraints, see Organization policy constraints.

Restrict load balancer types
Use an organization policy to restrict the Cloud Load Balancing types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:

Name: Restrict Load Balancer Creation Based on Load Balancer Types
ID:constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes
When you set the compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the Cloud Load Balancing types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:

INTERNAL_TCP_UDP for the internal passthrough Network Load Balancer
INTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional internal Application Load Balancer
GLOBAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the cross-region internal Application Load Balancer
EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP for the external passthrough Network Load Balancer
EXTERNAL_TCP_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with a TCP proxy
EXTERNAL_SSL_PROXY for the global external proxy Network Load Balancer with an SSL proxy
EXTERNAL_HTTP_HTTPS for the classic Application Load Balancer
EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the regional external Application Load Balancer
REGIONAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional external proxy Network Load Balancer
REGIONAL_INTERNAL_MANAGED_TCP_PROXY for the regional internal proxy Network Load Balancer
GLOBAL_EXTERNAL_MANAGED_HTTP_HTTPS for the global external Application Load Balancer
To include all internal or all external load balancer types, use the in: prefix followed by INTERNAL or EXTERNAL. For example, allowing in:INTERNAL allows all internal load balancers from the preceding list.

For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.

After you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing Cloud Load Balancing configurations.

If you attempt to create a load balancer of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:

Constraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes
violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
of type SCHEME is not allowed.
If you set multiple restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypesconstraints at different resource levels, they are enforced hierarchically. For this reason, we recommended that you set the inheritFromParent field to true, which ensures that policies at higher layers are also considered.

GKE error messages
If you are using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Service and Ingress objects, using this organization policy to restrict load balancer creation results in an error message similar to the following:

Warning  Sync    28s   loadbalancer-controller  Error during sync: error running
load balancer syncing routine: loadbalancer FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
does not exist: googleapi: Error 412:
Constraint constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes violated for
projects/PROJECT_ID. Forwarding Rule
projects/PROJECT_ID/global/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
of type LOAD_BALANCER_TYPE is not allowed, conditionNotMet
You can view GKE error messages by running the following commands:

kubectl get events -w
kubectl describe RESOURCE_KIND NAME
Replace the following:

RESOURCE_KIND: the kind of load balancer, ingress or service
NAME: the name of the load balancer
Disable global load balancing
This boolean constraint disables creation of global load-balancing products. When enforced, only regional load-balancing products without global dependencies can be created.

* Name: Disable Global Load Balancing
* ID:constraints/compute.disableGlobalLoadBalancing
By default, users are allowed to create global load-balancing products.

For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.

Restrict protocol forwarding types
Use an organization policy to restrict the protocol forwarding types that can be created in your organization. Set the following organization policy constraint:

Name: Restrict Protocol Forwarding Based on type of IP Address
ID:constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
When you set the compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of the protocol forwarding types. The list of allowed or denied values can only include values from the following list:

INTERNAL
EXTERNAL
For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.

After you set the policy, the policy is enforced when adding the respective Google Cloud forwarding rules. The constraint is not enforced on existing protocol forwarding configurations.

If you attempt to create a protocol forwarding deployment of a type that violates the constraint, the attempt fails and an error message is generated. The error message has the following format:

Constraint constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
violated for projects/PROJECT_NAME. Forwarding Rule
projects/PROJECT_NAME/region/REGION/forwardingRules/FORWARDING_RULE_NAME
of type SCHEME is not allowed.
If you set multiple restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes constraints at different resource levels, and if you set the inheritFromParent field to true, then the constraints are enforced hierarchically.

Enforce Shared VPC restrictions
Use the following organization policies to restrict how users are allowed to set up Shared VPC deployments.

Restrict Shared VPC host projects
This list constraint lets you restrict the Shared VPC host projects that a resource can attach to.

Name: Restrict Shared VPC host projects
ID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjects
By default, a project can attach to any host project in the same organization, thereby becoming a service project. When you set thecompute.restrictSharedVpcHostProjectsconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of host projects in the following ways:

Specify a project in the following format:
projects/PROJECT_ID
Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all projects under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format:
under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID
under:folders/FOLDER_ID
For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.

Restrict Shared VPC subnetworks
This list constraint defines the set of Shared VPC subnets that eligible resources can use. This constraint does not apply to resources within the same project.

Name: Restrict Shared VPC subnetworks
ID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks
By default, eligible resources can use any Shared VPC subnet. When you set the compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworksconstraint, you specify a restricted list of subnets in the following ways:

Specify a subnet in the following format:
projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME.
Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all subnets under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format:
under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID
under:folders/FOLDER_ID
under:projects/PROJECT_ID
For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.

Restrict cross-project backend services
Note: This constraint only applies to Shared VPC deployments that use cross-project service referencing. Currently, cross-project service referencing is only supported by internal Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers.
You can use this constraint to limit the backend services that a URL map can reference. This constraint does not apply to backend services within the same project as the URL map.

Name: Restrict cross-project backend services
ID:constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcBackendServices
By default, URL maps in all host or service projects can reference compatible backend services from other service projects or the host project in the same Shared VPC deployment as long as the user performing the action has thecompute.backendServices.usepermission. When you set therestrictSharedVpcBackendServicesconstraint, you specify an allowlist or denylist of backend services in the following ways:

Specify backend services in the following format:
projects/PROJECT_ID/regions/REGION/backendServices/BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME
Specify a project, folder, or organization. The constraint applies to all backend services under the specified resource in the resource hierarchy. Use the following format:
under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID
under:folders/FOLDER_ID
under:projects/PROJECT_ID
After you set up an organization policy with this constraint, the constraint goes into effect the next time you use the gcloud compute url-maps command to attach a backend service to a URL map. The constraint does not retroactively affect existing references to any cross-project backend services.

For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up list constraints with organization policies.

Restrict Shared VPC project lien removal
This boolean constraint restricts the set of users that can remove a Shared VPC host project lien without organization-level permission where this constraint is already set to True.

Name: Restrict Shared VPC project lien removal
ID:constraints/compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval
By default, any user with the permission to update liens can remove a Shared VPC host project lien. Enforcing this constraint requires that permission be granted at the organization level.

For sample instructions about how to use this constraint, see Set up boolean constraints with organization policies.
