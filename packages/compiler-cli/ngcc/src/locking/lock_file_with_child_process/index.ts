/**
 * This LockFile implenentation uses a child-process to remove the lock file when the main process
 * exits (for whatever reason).
 *
 * There is a few milliseconds between the child-process being forked and it registering its
 * `disconnect` event, which is responsible for tidying up the lockFile in the even that the main
 * process exits unexpectedly.
 *
 * We eagerly create the unlocker child-process so that it maximizes the time before the lockFile is
 * actually written, which makes it very unlikely that the unlocker would not be ready in the case
 * that the developer hits Ctrl-C or closes the terminal within a fraction of a second of the
 * lockfile being created.
 *
 * The worst case scenario is that ngcc is killed too quickly and leaves behind an orphaned
 * lockFile. In which case the next ngcc run will display a helpful error message about deleting the
 * lockFile.
