Introduction to Angular 

@description

Angular modules are the building blocks of Angular apps. There are three 
approaches to choose from:

#### Modules 101

[Root AppModule](guide/appmodule) provides an introduction to the structure and use of the 
root module. Start here if you're new to modules or want 
an overview of the basics.

#### Modules in detail

[NgModule](guide/ngmodule) covers modules in depth. Topics include structure, lazy loading 
modules, feature modules, shared modules, and `forRoot` along with a number of live examples. 
This is for those familiar with Angular modules who want a closer look.

#### Modules FAQ

The [Angular Module FAQ](guide/ngmodule-faq) answers specific questions about declarations, imports, exports, 
service providers, entry components, and more.
