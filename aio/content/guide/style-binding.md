# Style binding

Use style binding to set styles dynamically.

## Prerequisites

* TBD

## Binding to a single style

To create a single style binding, use the prefix `style` followed by a dot and the name of the CSS style.

To set the ‘width’ style, type the following:

[style.width]="width"

Angular sets the property to the value of the bound expression, which is usually a string.
Optionally, you can add a unit extension like `em` or `%`, which requires a number type.

<div class="alert is-helpful">

1. To write a style in dash-case, type the following:

<code-example language="html">&lt;nav [style.background-color]="expression"
&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;

2. To write a style in camelCase, type the following:

  &lt;nav [style.backgroundColor]="expression"
&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code-example>

</div>

## Binding to multiple styles

To toggle multiple styles, bind to the `[style]` attribute&mdash;for example, `[style]="styleExpression"`.
The `styleExpression` can be one of:

* A string list of styles such as `"width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: cornflowerblue;"`.
* An object with style names as the keys and style values as the values, such as `{width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: 'cornflowerblue'}`.

Note that binding an array to `[style]` is not supported.

<div class="alert is-important">

When binding `[style]` to an object expression, the identity of the object must change for Angular to update the class list.
Updating the property without changing object identity has no effect.

</div>

### Single and multiple-style binding example

<code-example path="attribute-binding/src/app/single-and-multiple-style-binding.component.ts" header="nav-bar.component.ts">
</code-example>

If there are multiple bindings to the same style attribute, Angular uses [styling precedence](guide/style-precedence) to determine which binding to use.

The following table summarizes style binding syntax.

<style>
  td, th {vertical-align: top}
</style>

<table width="100%">
  <col width="15%">
  </col>
  <col width="20%">
  </col>
  <col width="35%">
  </col>
  <col width="30%">
  </col>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Binding Type
    </th>
    <th>
      Syntax
    </th>
    <th>
      Input Type
    </th>
    <th>
      Example Input Values
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single style binding</td>
    <td><code>[style.width]="width"</code></td>
    <td><code>string | undefined | null</code></td>
    <td><code>"100px"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single style binding with units</td>
    <td><code>[style.width.px]="width"</code></td>
    <td><code>number | undefined | null</code></td>
    <td><code>100</code></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td rowspan=2>Multi-style binding</td>
    <td rowspan=2><code>[style]="styleExpression"</code></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td><code>"width: 100px; height: 100px"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Record&lt;string, string | undefined | null&gt;</code></td>
    <td><code>{width: '100px', height: '100px'}</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div class="alert is-helpful">

The [NgStyle](guide/built-in-directives/#ngstyle) directive can be used as an alternative to direct `[style]` bindings.
However, using the preceding style binding syntax without `NgStyle` is preferred because due to improvements in style binding in Angular, `NgStyle` no longer provides significant value, and might eventually be removed in the future.

</div>

{@a styling-precedence}
## Styling precedence

A single HTML element can have its CSS class list and style values bound to multiple sources (for example, host bindings from multiple directives).

When there are multiple bindings to the same class name or style property, Angular uses a set of precedence rules to resolve conflicts and determine which classes or styles are ultimately applied to the element.

<div class="alert is-helpful">
<h4>Styling precedence (highest to lowest)</h4>

1. Template bindings
    1. Property binding (for example, `<div [class.foo]="hasFoo">` or `<div [style.color]="color">`)
    1. Map binding (for example, `<div [class]="classExpr">` or `<div [style]="styleExpr">`)
    1. Static value (for example, `<div class="foo">` or `<div style="color: blue">`)
1. Directive host bindings
    1. Property binding (for example, `host: {'[class.foo]': 'hasFoo'}` or `host: {'[style.color]': 'color'}`)
    1. Map binding (for example, `host: {'[class]': 'classExpr'}` or `host: {'[style]': 'styleExpr'}`)
    1. Static value (for example, `host: {'class': 'foo'}` or `host: {'style': 'color: blue'}`)
1. Component host bindings
    1. Property binding (for example, `host: {'[class.foo]': 'hasFoo'}` or `host: {'[style.color]': 'color'}`)
    1. Map binding (for example, `host: {'[class]': 'classExpr'}` or `host: {'[style]': 'styleExpr'}`)
    1. Static value (for example, `host: {'class': 'foo'}` or `host: {'style': 'color: blue'}`)

</div>

The more specific a class or style binding is, the higher its precedence.

A binding to a specific class (for example, `[class.foo]`) takes precedence over a generic `[class]` binding, and a binding to a specific style (for example, `[style.bar]`) takes precedence over a generic `[style]` binding.

<code-example path="attribute-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="basic-specificity" header="src/app/app.component.html"></code-example>

Specificity rules also apply when it comes to bindings that originate from different sources.
It's possible for an element to have bindings in the template where it's declared, from host bindings on matched directives, and from host bindings on matched components.

Template bindings are the most specific because they apply to the element directly and exclusively, so they have the highest precedence.

Directive host bindings are considered less specific because directives can be used in multiple locations, so they have a lower precedence than template bindings.

Directives often augment component behavior, so host bindings from components have the lowest precedence.

<code-example path="attribute-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="source-specificity" header="src/app/app.component.html"></code-example>

In addition, bindings take precedence over static attributes.

In the following case, `class` and `[class]` have similar specificity, but the `[class]` binding takes precedence because it is dynamic.

<code-example path="attribute-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="dynamic-priority" header="src/app/app.component.html"></code-example>

{@a styling-delegation}
### Delegating to styles with lower precedence

It is possible for higher precedence styles to "delegate" to lower precedence styles using `undefined` values.
Whereas setting a style property to `null` ensures the style is removed, setting it to `undefined` causes Angular to fall back to the next-highest precedence binding to that style.

For example, consider the following template:

<code-example path="attribute-binding/src/app/app.component.html" region="style-delegation" header="src/app/app.component.html"></code-example>

Imagine that the `dirWithHostBinding` directive and the `comp-with-host-binding` component both have a `[style.width]` host binding.
In that case, if `dirWithHostBinding` sets its binding to `undefined`, the `width` property falls back to the value of the `comp-with-host-binding` host binding.
However, if `dirWithHostBinding` sets its binding to `null`, the `width` property will be removed entirely.
