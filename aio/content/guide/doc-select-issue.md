# Select a documentation issue

This topic describes how to select an Angular documentation issue to fix.

Angular documentation issues are stored in the **Issues** tab of the [angular/angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) repo.
Documentation issues can be identified by the `comp: docs` label and they are labeled by priority.

You are welcome to work on any issue.
If you know of a problem in the documentation that hasn't been reported, you can also [create a new documentation issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=3-docs-bug.yaml).

Fixing higher priority issues is more valuable to the community.
If you're new to open source software, maybe a lower priority issue or a `good first issue` would be a better place for you to start.
Every contribution helps improve the documentation.
