# `@Input` and `@Output` properties


So far, you've focused mainly on binding to component members within template expressions and statements
that appear on the *right side of the binding declaration*.
A member in that position is a data binding **source**.

This section concentrates on binding to **targets**, which are directive
properties on the *left side of the binding declaration*.
These directive properties must be declared as **inputs** or **outputs**.

<div class="alert is-important">

Remember: All **components** are **directives**.

</div>

<div class="l-sub-section">

Note the important distinction between a data binding **target** and a data binding **source**.

The *target* of a binding is to the *left* of the `=`.
The *source* is on the *right* of the `=`.

The *target* of a binding is the property or event inside the binding punctuation: `[]`, `()` or `[()]`.
The *source* is either inside quotes (`" "`) or within an interpolation (`{{}}`).

Every member of a **source** directive is automatically available for binding.
You don't have to do anything special to access a directive member in a template expression or statement.

You have *limited* access to members of a **target** directive.
You can only bind to properties that are explicitly identified as *inputs* and *outputs*.

</div>

In the following snippet, `iconUrl` and `onSave` are data-bound members of the `AppComponent`
and are referenced within quoted syntax to the _right_ of the equals&nbsp;(`=`).

<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/app.component.html" region="io-1" title="src/app/app.component.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

They are *neither inputs nor outputs* of the component. They are **sources** for their bindings.
The targets are the native `<img>` and `<button>` elements.

Now look at a another snippet in which the `HeroDetailComponent`
is the **target** of a binding on the _left_ of the equals&nbsp;(`=`).

<!-- KW--This needs an illustration. I get lost in the words and have to read them slowly.
Simple arrows would help. -->
<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/app.component.html" region="io-2" title="src/app/app.component.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

Both `HeroDetailComponent.hero` and `HeroDetailComponent.deleteRequest` are on the **left side** of binding declarations.
`HeroDetailComponent.hero` is inside brackets; it is the target of a property binding.
`HeroDetailComponent.deleteRequest` is inside parentheses; it is the target of an event binding.

### Declaring `@Input` and `@Output` properties

You must explicitly mark target properties as inputs or outputs.

In the `HeroDetailComponent`, you mark such properties as input or output properties using decorators.

<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/hero-detail.component.ts" region="input-output-1" title="src/app/hero-detail.component.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>

Alternatively, you can identify members in the `inputs` and `outputs` arrays
of the directive metadata, as in this example:

<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/hero-detail.component.ts" region="input-output-2" title="src/app/hero-detail.component.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>

You can specify an input/output property either with a decorator or in a metadata array,
but there is no need to do both.


### `@Input` or `@Output`?
<!-- KW--Is there a way to elaborate just a little on the difference? -->
*Input* properties usually receive data values.
*Output* properties expose event producers, such as `EventEmitter` objects.

The terms _input_ and _output_ reflect the perspective of the target directive.

</figure>

`HeroDetailComponent.hero` is an **input** property from the perspective of `HeroDetailComponent`
because data flows *into* that property from a template binding expression.

`HeroDetailComponent.deleteRequest` is an **output** property from the perspective of `HeroDetailComponent`
because events stream *out* of that property and toward the handler in a template binding statement.

### Aliasing input/output properties

Sometimes the public name of an input/output property should be different from the internal name.

This is frequently the case with [attribute directives](guide/attribute-directives).
Directive consumers expect to bind to the name of the directive.
For example, when you apply a directive with a `myClick` selector to a `<div>` tag,
you expect to bind to an event property that is also called `myClick`.

<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/app.component.html" region="myClick" title="src/app/app.component.html" linenums="false">
</code-example>

However, the directive name is often a poor choice for the name of a property within the directive class.
The directive name rarely describes what the property does.
The `myClick` directive name is not a good name for a property that emits click messages.

Fortunately, you can have a public name for the property that meets conventional expectations,
while using a different name internally.
In the example immediately above, you are actually binding *through the* `myClick` *alias* to
the directive's own `clicks` property.

You can specify the alias for the property name by passing it into the input/output decorator like this:
<!-- KW--A diagram might be helpful here. -->
<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/click.directive.ts" region="output-myClick" title="src/app/click.directive.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>

You can also alias property names in the `inputs` and `outputs` arrays.
You write a colon-delimited (`:`) string with
the directive property name on the *left* and the public alias on the *right*:

<code-example path="template-syntax/src/app/click.directive.ts" region="output-myClick2" title="src/app/click.directive.ts" linenums="false">
</code-example>
