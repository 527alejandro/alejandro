# Accessibility in Angular

The Internet is used by a wide variety of people, including those who have visual or motor impairments.
A variety of assistive technologies (AT) are available that make it much easier for these groups to
interact with web-based software applications.
In addition, designing an application to be more accessible generally improves the user experience for all users.

For an in-depth introduction to accessibility issues and techniques for designing accessible applications that follow Google guidelines, see the [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/#what_is_accessibility) section of the [Google Web Developer’s Guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/).

This page discusses best practices for designing Angular applications that
work well for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies.

## Accessibility attributes

Angular can help you build more inclusive applications that conform to Google's accessibility guidelines.
Use [attribute binding](guide/template-syntax#attribute-binding) template syntax to control the values of accessibility-related attributes.

* Accessibility is supported by many native HTML5 controls through attributes such as `label`, which provides a text alternative to an image that can be used by screen readers, and `tabindex` which provides a non-visual indication of how focus is expected to progress among elements on a page. Native HTML5 attributes should be used wherever possible.

* Accessibility is further supported by [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), a well-documented suite of tools and standards.
ARIA defines additional accessibility-related HTML attributes that can be added to standard HTML elements such as `<div>` and `<form>`. An HTML element can include both ARIA attributes and the standard HTML attributes. The prefix "aria-" makes it easy to spot an ARIA attribute. For examples of how to integrate ARIA with an Angular application, see [ARIA and Angular](guide/a11y-aria).

<div class="alert is-helpful">

   You will see references to "ARIA Properties", but these properties are implemented as HTML *attributes*, so you will use Angular [attribute binding](guide/template-syntax#attribute-binding) to set their values, rather than Angular [property binding](guide/template-syntax#attribute-binding).

   Remember that HTML attributes use lowercase names (`tabindex`), while properties use camelCase names (`tabIndex`)

</div>

## Angular UI components

[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is a suite of reusable UI components that aim to be fully accessible.
The [Component Development Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) includes the `a11y` package to support accessibility.

```
@import '~@angular/cdk/text-field/text-field';
@include cdk-a11y();
```

The package provides tools that support various areas of accessibility.
For example:

* `LiveAnnouncer` is used to announce messages for screen-reader users using an `aria-live` region. See the W3C documentation for more information on [aria-live regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/states_and_properties#aria-live).

* The `cdkTrapFocus` directive traps Tab-key focus within an element. Use it to create accessible experience for components like modal dialogs, where focus must be constrained.

For full details of these and other tools, see the [Material CDK a11y overview](https://material.angular.io/cdk/a11y/overview).

The `cdk-a11y` package also comes with a set of CSS styles that can be used when building accessible components.
To take advantage of them, you have to include the styles in your global stylesheet.
If you're using Angular Components (Material) together with the CDK, these styles have been included for you already.

**WIP: OUTLINE FROM JE/KW**
### Case study: Building a custom progress bar

* Shows using ARIA host binding (role, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, attr.aria-valuenow, aria-disabled)
* Gist of the component: just has @Input for value which feeds into the aria attributes
* https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-kn5jdi?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html

## Managing focus after navigation

* *Short discussion of why focus is important*
* Best practices around managing focus after navigation
* Code example of directing focus on navigation -- Probably something like just focusing the <h2> on navigation

###  Example: building a custom slider

The following example demonstrates the use of keyboard shortcuts in building a custom slider.
*more about exactly what the example demonstrates -- possibly in comments*

## Accessibility attributes in native HTML elements

Use native HTML elements when appropriate.
Although this approach is slightly less concise than wrapping the native element in a custom element,
it leads to smaller component code and more control over how the interaction is composed.

* Attribute selectors for `@Component` for things like `<button>`
   * Examples from Angular Material: `MatButton`, `MatNavTabs`, `MatTable`
   * Don’t have to proxy native properties or ARIA attributes
* Use a wrapper element when the native element doesn’t support children
  * Example: `MatFormField` wrapping native `<input>` (use content projection)
  * Don’t have to proxy native properties or ARIA attributes
