# Docs contribution types

## Prerequisites

To contribute to the Angular documentation you should be familiar with the following.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/doc)
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)
* [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.MD)

Additionally, you can [run the docs locally]() as you work on them so you can see your change as it renders in the browser.

## Ways to contribute to Angular

### PRs and Issues

Submitting [pull requests (PRs)](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and filing [issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are ways that you can contribute to Angular.
PRs and issues allow the community to track particular issues and contributions.

### Discussions and reviews

<!-- Describe how members of the community can participate without having to submit PRs -->

Though many people contribute to Angular by submitting PRs and filing issues, there are other ways to contribute as well.
These include joining in on discussions, helping other contributors navigate git and Github if necessary, and helping PR authors ensure the accuracy of their contributions.

An important way to contribute to the documentation is to discuss ideas in [Angular GitHub issues](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues) and to leave review comments in [Angular GitHub PRs](https://github.com/angular/angular/pulls).

If you understand the topic well, you can help ensure accuracy, that pertinent use cases are covered, and that authors adhere to best practices.
If the topic is new to you, your perspective is just as helpful.
If you see an issue or PR that appeals to you, but that could use some clarification, if you comment with questions or observations to that effect, PR authors will be aware of the need for extra clarity on particular points.
If you find a concept or wording in a document to be confusing, you most certainly are not the only one.

Participating in discussions and reviews on GitHub is one way to contribute without needing to submit a PR.

### Inclusivity and word choice

<!-- Discuss inclusivity in the docs -->

If you see anything in the documentation, example apps, or anywhere on [angular.io](https://angular.io), that could be more inclusive, consider filing an issue, opening a PR, or reaching out to any team member.

Examples of improving inclusivity in the documentation include removing the assumption that something is "simple", improving accessibility, encouraging counter-stereotypes, and choosing inclusive language (avoiding things like "you guys").

<!-- It would be nice to have a way that people could confidentially note such topics to us if they wanted to as sometimes an issue regarding inclusivity can heat up. -->

### English as a second language

<!-- Discuss the unique perspective of the non-native English speaker -->

Many Angular developers natively speak languages other than English.
Sometimes the documentation can include colloquialisms, idiomatic expressions, and subtle grammatical structures that may be challenging for non-native speakers to understand.
While the documentation team works daily to clarify these elements of the documentation, you may notice others that are outstanding.

If you are a non-native speaker of English or understand the specific challenges of English as a second language, and see something that could be clearer, file an issue or PR and let the docs team know.

Millions of people are heritage speakers, that is people who live in a country with a dominant language that differs from that which they speak at home.
Becoming fully native speaker in a language is a complex and often multi-generational process.
Because of this, even first and second generation speakers whose English is fluent can provide valuable insight into word choice, sentence structure, and subtle colloqualisms.

Examples of phrasing that could hinder understanding include phrases such as, "were you to", "should you decide", "as-is", "comprises/comprised", and "stable of heroes".
While such phrases are grammatically correct, they are not always clear to non-native speakers.


## Content
<!-- Discuss what kind of content contributions there are -->

Contributing to the Angular documentation is a great way to make Angular better and be a part of the Open Source Software (OSS) community.

There are many options for contribution ranging from the minimal typo fix to contributing new content for previously undocumented features.

Before submitting a PR, check the [current open docs PRs](https://github.com/angular/angular/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22comp%3A+docs%22) in case someone has already submitted the work you have in mind.

For ideas on a type of PR to submit, check the [current open docs issues](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22comp%3A+docs%22).
If your idea is complex or you would like clarity, you can comment in an existing issue or file a new one so that everyone can discuss your idea.

### Typo fixes

The smallest and easiest fixes in the Angular docs include copy edits such as typographical errors, grammar, punctuation, and standardization of key words.
One example is making sure that methods include the parentheses, omit the leading dot, and are in back ticks such as `myMethod()`, instead of .myMethod.

To expedite the review process, keep such pull requests small.
It is easier to review a PR with a few changes in one or two files rather than many changes across a number of files.

### Clarification

Sometimes a particular phrase or paragraph could be clearer.
Clarification can include removal of colloquial phrases, shortening sentences, or adding a sentence or two to make sure that a point is in straightforward language.

### New content

There are features that the docs team has yet to document.
If you would like to contribute new content, [file an issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/new/choose) so that the community can discuss your idea and the docs team can help you find the right place for the new content.
Filing an issue first can save you time and effort in the case that a particular feature is going to be deprecated, or someone is already working on documenting that feature.

## Example code

<!-- Discuss the ways in which people can contribute to the example apps. -->

The Angular documentation has many working example apps that provide most of the code snippets in the guides.

### Formatting fixes

Properly formatted code aids in understanding and helps readers see where things such as classes and functions begin and end.
A change to formatting could include for example, moving a curly brace or parenthesis, indenting a block of code, or otherwise changing the spacing.

### Aligning code snippets with documentation

When a guide describes how to create a certain example, ideally that guide should explain the most important parts of the featured code snippets.

While a guide necessarily assumes a certain amount of pre-requisite knowledge, there are instances where the location or meaning of a code snippet needs more explanation.

### Updating example code

Sometimes when something is deprecated, it may still be in one of the examples apps.
While team members try to update these along with implementing the deprecation, sometimes one or two still need to be updated.
