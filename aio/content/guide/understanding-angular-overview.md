# Understanding Angular

As described in [What Is Angular][angular-overview], the Angular frameworks consists of four basic elements:

* Components
* Templates
* Dependency injection
* Directives

Not every application uses all four elements equally. But understanding these elements can help you build scalable, robust Angular applications.
