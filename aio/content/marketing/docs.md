# Welcome to the Angular documentation

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

Angular is an application framework. That means that every Angular application uses a common set of elements.
Angular also includes built-in tools and libraries for popular features such as routing, forms, and HTTP requests.
When you build your applications, you can use as many or as few of these features as you want. And, as your applications
grow, you can easily add the features you want, knowing that each feature is designed to work seamlessly with the rest
of the framework.

## Before you begin

You can get started coding with Angular right away. However, having an understanding of the following technologies
can make your learning experience easier. You don't have to be an expert in these technologies, but we at least
recommend having access to resources about these technologies nearby.

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML "Learn HTML")
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps "Learn CSS")
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "Learn JavaScript"), including:
  * [The latest standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources "Latest JavaScript standards")
  * [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes "ES2015 Classes")
  * [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import "ES2015 Modules")
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript")

## Learn Angular by exploring

If you prefer to explore new technologies firsthand, we recommend that you visit these sections of the Angular
documentation:

1. [Try it tutorial](start). The Try It tutorial is a great way to become familiar with Angular application development.
This tutorial uses Stackblitz.io as its development environment, which means you can explore a fully functional
application without any installation requirements.

1. [Elements of Angular](). This topic should be your next stop as you read the Angular.io documentation. This topic
provides brief, high-level overviews of coding elements that are common to most Angular applications.

1. [Setup](guide/setup-local). At this point, you might be ready to try building a few Angular applications on your own. The
Setup topic describes the few steps you need to follow to create Angular applications locally.

1. [Understanding Angular](). While the Try It and Elements of Angular topics provide a good overview of
the Angular development experience, there many additional features and capabilities of Angular you might want
to explore. The Understanding Angular section gives you the opportunity to learn more about what you
can do with Angular's common coding elements.

1. [Developer Guides](). Angular has a number of features and best practices that you can use to build
all sorts of applications. The Developer Guides section provides you with the information you need to put
these features and practices to use.

## Learn Angular by reading

If you prefer to learn new technologies by studying their key concepts and methodologies, we recommend you
visit these sections of the Angular documentation:

1. [Elements of Angular](). This topic provides brief, high-level overviews of coding elements that are common
to most Angular applications.

1. [Understanding Angular](). The Understanding Angular section provides a list of topics that describe what you
can do with Angular's common coding elements. We recommend skimming through the contents of this section first,
then reading more thoroughly the sections that are the most relevant to you.

1. [Developer Guides](). Angular has a number of features and best practices that you can use to build
all sorts of applications. The Developer Guides section provides you with the information you need to put
these features and practices to use. Again, we recommend skimming through the contents of this section first,
then reading the topics that interest you most in more detail.

1. [Setup](guide/setup-local). At this point, you might be ready to try building a few Angular applications on your own. The
Setup topic describes the few steps you need to follow to create Angular applications locally.

## Assumptions


These docs assume that you are already familiar with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML "Learn HTML"), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps "Learn CSS"), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "Learn JavaScript"),
and some of the tools from the [latest standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources "Latest JavaScript standards"), such as [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes "ES2015 Classes") and [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import "ES2015 Modules").
The code samples are written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript").
Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript, using [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html "TypeScript Types") for dependency injection, and using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html "Decorators") for metadata.
