# Create  a project with `ng new`

```
ng new <project name>
```

Your first task when developing with Angular is to create a new project. An easy way to create a project is with the
Angular CLI command, `ng new`. In this section, you will create a new project called `tour-of-heroes`.

## Before you begin

Follow the steps described in [Before you begin](gettingstarted/before-you-begin).

## Steps

**To create a new project**

## About your new project

An Angular project consists of the set of file that make up an application, library, or an end-to-end (e2e) tests. Projects, in turn, reside in an Angular [workspace](guide/glossary#workspace).

## What's next

Your next step is to create your first Angular component.
