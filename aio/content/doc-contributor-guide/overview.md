# Contribute to the Angular documentation

If you would like to help contribute to the Angular documentation or website, we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can
contribute, whether you’re new to the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a 
developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

For information on the Angular documentation content and style, see our documentation style guide.
