# Create great Angular docs

If you would like to help contribute to the Angular documentation or website, we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can
contribute, whether you’re new to the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a 
developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

This topic covers what you need to know to contribute to the Angular documentation set, including:

* An overview of the types of content in the Angular documentation
* A list of different types of contributions you can might consider

## Choosing a documentation type

The content that you see on [angular.io](https://www.angular.io) typically falls into one of two categories:

* **Guides**. *Guide* content consists of topics that focus on covering a specific task or concept. For example,
[this topic on Routing](/guide/router) provides conceptual information on how to use Angular's routing features
to change what view an application's user sees.
* **API**. *API* content consists of topics that describe Angular's classes, functions, properties, and other parts
of the Angular framework.

Generally speaking, if you want to help users accomplish a specific task or understand a particular concept, you're
writing a guide. If you want to clarify how a specific part of the Angular framework functions, you're updating the
API content.

These categories matter because the workflow for creating and updating content differs depending on whether you
are adding content to the Angular guides or to the API. For more information, see
[Start contributing](/doc-contributor-guide/start-contributing).

## Making contributions to the documentation

You can contribute to the Angular documentation in many ways.

* **Issues**. One of the easiest ways to contribute to the documentation is file a GitHub issue. These issues let
us know what changes you'd like to see in the documentation. Issues range from identifying a typo to requesting a
new topic. For more information, see [Filing documentation issues](/doc-contributor-guide/start-contributing#filing-documentation-issues).
* **Minor updates**. *Minor updates* are small changes that have minimal impact on the documentation set. Examples
of minor updates include fixing spelling or grammar mistakes or updating a topic heading. For more information,
see [Making minor updates](/doc-contributor-guide/start-contributing#making-minor-updates).
* **Major updates**. *Major updates* are large changes that can have significant impact on the documentation set.
Examples of major updates include adding new topics, rewriting an existing topic, or making structural changes to
the documentation's layout. For more information, see [Making major updates](/doc-contributor-guide/start-contributing#making-major-updates).
