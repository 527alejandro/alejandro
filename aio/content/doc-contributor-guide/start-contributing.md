# Start contributing

If you want to get started contributing to the Angular documentation, this
page and its linked topics can help you get started. You don't need to be a
developer or a technical writer to make a big impact on the Angular
documentation and user experience! All you need for the topics on this page is
a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and a web browser.

If you're looking for information on how to start contributing to Angular
code repositories, refer to
[the Angular community guidelines](https://angular.io/contribute).

## The basics of Angular documentation

The Angular documentation lives in the `aio` directory of the
[Angular GitHub repository](https://github.com/angular/angular). You write
documentation using a Markdown format.
