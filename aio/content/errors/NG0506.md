@name Application not stable 
@category runtime
@shortDescription Application did not become stable in time

@description
This warning occurs when hydration is enabled on the client but the application remained unstable for an exessive amount of time. 

{@link ApplicationRef#isStable} reports changes of states of the `NgZone`, switch between `stable` and `unstable`. 
The `NgZone` is stable when there are no pending microtasks or macrotasks.

Hydration relies on a signal from Zone.js when it becomes stable inside an application, so that Angular can start the serialization process on the server or post-hydration cleanup on the client to remove DOM nodes that remained unclaimed.

**Macrotasks**

Macrotasks include functions like `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame` etc. 
If one of these functions is called in the initialization phase of the app or the bootstrapped components, the application will remain unstable. 

```typescript
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app',
  template: ``,
})
class SimpleComponent {
    constructor() {
        setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000)

        // or 

        setTimeout(() => { ... }, 20_000)
    }
}
```

If these functions need to be called in the initialization phase, invoking them outside the angular zone solves the issue.  

```typescript
class SimpleComponent {
    constructor() {
      inject(NgZone).runOutsideAngular(() => {
        setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
      })
    }
}
```

// TODO: Add more examples of causes for unstable apps.


@debugging

Verify that you don't have any long standing microtask or macrotasks.
