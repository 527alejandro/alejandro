@shortDescription ngAcceptInputType coercion hints to the template type-checker are deprecated

@description
Angular found a static field in a component class that begins with `ngAcceptInputType_`.

These fields hint to Angular's template type-checker that the associated `@Input` can accept a wider type than its corresponding field returns.

For example, you might want an `@Input` that is logically `boolean`, but also accepts (and converts) the strings `'true'` and `'false'`. In the past, you would perform this conversion in the setter, and use an `ngAcceptInputType` hint to inform the template type-checker of the wider for the setter. For example:

```typescript
@Component({...})
export class MyInputComponent {
  private _disabled: boolean = false;

  @Input()
  get disabled(): boolean {
    return this._disabled;
  }

  set disabled(value: boolean) {
    // Widen the type of value. We'll tell Angular's type checker that even
    // though this type is a boolean, our setter can actually handle 'true',
    // 'false', or the empty string as well. This is useful if someone binds
    // this input as an attribute:
    //
    // <my-input disbled>
    //
    // This is equivalent to setting the disabled input to the empty string.
    const widerValue = value as boolean|'true'|'false'|'';

    // We know here that widerValue can be 'true', 'false', '', or a boolean.
    if (widerValue === 'true' || widerValue === '') {
      this._disabled = true;
    } else if (widerValue === 'false') {
      this._disabled = false;
    } else {
      this._disabled = widerValue;
    }
  }

  // Hint to Angular's type-checker that the disabled input accepts more than
  // its type signature would suggest:
  static ngAcceptInputType_disabled: boolean|'true'|'false'|'';
}
```

@debugging
Such hints were previously necessary because TypeScript enforced that the getter and setter had the same type. However, as of TypeScript 4.3 this is no longer the case, and setters are now allowed to have a wider type than their corresponding getter. This makes `ngAcceptInputType` unnecessary to express this semantic. In the example above, the setter for `disabled` could instead be directly given a wider type:

```typescript
export class MyInputCmp {
  // ...

  get disabled(): boolean {
    return this._disabled;
  }

  set disabled(value: boolean|'true'|'false'|'') {
    // The same logic as before, without the need to cast value to a wider type.
  }
}
```

Angular now warns when it encounters the deprecated `ngAcceptInputType` fields, and you should convert them to getter/setter pairs with differening types as shown above.
